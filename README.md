# Washington Post Article Scraper with Comments Extraction

This repository contains two Python scripts designed to scrape article content, including comments, from The Washington Post website. The scripts leverage `Selenium` and `BeautifulSoup` to automate the process of logging in, navigating to articles, extracting content, and retrieving comments. The credentials and other required information are read from a configuration file.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.6+**
- **Google Chrome browser**
- **ChromeDriver**
- **Required Python packages** (install using pip):
  ```bash
  pip install requests beautifulsoup4 selenium webdriver-manager


Overview
The project consists of two main scripts:

ScrapWasPostArtclesURL.py: Fetches article URLs from a specified subsection of The Washington Post and saves them into a JSON file.

ScrapWasPostArticlesContent.py: Takes the JSON file generated by the first script, scrapes each article's content (headline, subheading, body text), and fetches comments embedded in an iframe. The extracted data is saved into individual JSON files.

Both scripts read the required inputs (email, password, start date, end date, and subsection) from a config.json file.

Configuration

Create a config.json file in the root directory of your project with the following structure:
{
  "email": "your_email@example.com",
  "password": "your_password"
}

Explanation of Configuration Fields:

email: Your Washington Post account email.
password: Your Washington Post account password.

Steps to Run the Scripts

Step 1: Create a config.json file as described in the Configuration section.

Step 2: Run ScrapWasPostArtclesURL.py to fetch the article URLs from The Washington Post.
This will create a JSON file containing a list of URLs based on the date range and subsection you specify in the config.json file.

Step 3: Run ScrapWasPostArticlesContent.py to scrape the content and comments from the URLs generated in Step 2.
This script will create individual JSON files for each article, containing the headline, subheading, body, and comments.

Notes
Authentication: Both scripts require login credentials to access The Washington Post's content. Ensure you have entered valid email and password details in the config.json file.

Subsections: The first script supports scraping from various subsections like politics, business, world, technology, and more. Make sure to specify a valid subsection.

Error Handling: The scripts include error handling for various cases, including missing elements, failed authentication, and more. Invalid URLs or errors during scraping may result in the JSON file being deleted to ensure clean data output.

Customization: You can easily modify the scripts to scrape different subsections or adjust the date range according to your requirements.
